			<h1>SMEs and Adaptation</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
	Adaptation is an imperative. The world is ever changing. People, enterprises and governments are being challenged to prepare for and minimize the effects of growing changes in climate, population, urbanization, resource availability and other “global forces” that challenge economic development locally and globally. Decreasing water supplies, shifting agricultural patterns, larger coastal 
	populations at risk from flooding and disrupted energy and transport systems are but a few of these challenges.<br><br>
	
	In Mexico, small-and-medium-size enterprises will be key in ensuring that human and economic development 
	continue in the face of increasing natural disasters, growing coastal populations and resource scarcity. 
	As SMEs provide at least 20% of Mexico's GDP and employ approximately one-quarter of all laborers, building 
	resilience within the SME supply chain and encouraging SMEs to invest in sectors crucial to helping communities adapt is essential.<br><br> 
	
	The SME Adaptation project will help SMEs in Mexico build this resilience by providing resources, a platform for information sharing amongst entrepreneurs, data on vulnerability and investment opportunities and a set of adaptation guidelines. This project will also bring awareness to the government officials, corporate leaders and NGOs on the need to engage with 
	SMEs and facilitate this much-needed investment. <br><br>
