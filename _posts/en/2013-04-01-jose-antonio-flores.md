	This is the rest of the post. Strengthening of strategic adaptation capacities. Expected outcomes are: balance between deforestation/forest degradation and reforestation/forest restoration; adoption and implementation of sustainable agricultural production systems; eradication of measures that promote environmental damage and GHG emissions; implementation of programs for relocating human settlements and high-risk infrastructure; and implementation of public policies on climate stability and sustainable development.
