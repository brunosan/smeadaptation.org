	El a;o pasado, M'exico became <a href="http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/06/26/mexicos-climate-change-law/">one of the first nations</a> &nbsp;to pass a comprehensive climate change law that addresses both mitigation AND adaptation. The "General Climate Change Law" sets up the boundaries or legal framework for various government ministries to implement specific climate and adaptation initiatives.
</p>
<p >
	For adaptation, three goals/stages have been <a class="c9" href="http://www.cambioclimatico.gob.mx/index.php/politica-nacional-sobre-cambio-climatico.html#adaptacion">established</a>:

<dl>
	<dt> 1st Stage:from 2008 to 2012: </dt><dd> Evaluation of Mexico's vulnerability and an economic assessment of priority measures. One of the expected priority outcomes is the designing of a comprehensive adaptation system – to be implemented progressively.

		<dt>2nd stage:from 2013 to 2030: </dt><dd> Strengthening of strategic adaptation capacities. Expected outcomes are: balance between deforestation/forest degradation and reforestation/forest restoration; adoption and implementation of sustainable agricultural production systems; eradication of measures that promote environmental damage and GHG emissions; implementation of programs for relocating human settlements and high-risk infrastructure; and implementation of public policies on climate stability and sustainable development.</dd>
		<dt>3rd stage: from 2030 to 2050: </dt><dd> Consolidation of capacities achieved. Expected outcomes include: a positive balance between reforestation and deforestation; development alternatives that ensure environmental sustainability; and a strengthened national planning system based on criteria for the “decarbonization” of the economy and on minimizing vulnerability to climate change.</dd>

			Guidelines for the private sector, while not being publicized widely, are being &nbsp;developed and integrated into these plans. We are working with and in contact with several experts contributing to this effort and hope to share more information on these developments soon.
