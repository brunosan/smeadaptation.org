	This is an example post of geotagged info with <a href="http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/06/26/mexicos-climate-change-law/">links</a> and a first paragraph

	This is the rest of the post. Strengthening of strategic adaptation capacities. Expected outcomes are: balance between deforestation/forest degradation and reforestation/forest restoration; adoption and implementation of sustainable agricultural production systems; eradication of measures that promote environmental damage and GHG emissions; implementation of programs for relocating human settlements and high-risk infrastructure; and implementation of public policies on climate stability and sustainable development.
