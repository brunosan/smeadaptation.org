			<h1>SMEs and Adaptation</h1>
			
			<p>
			Adaptation is an imperative. The world is ever changing. People are being challenged to prepare for and, if possible, minimize the effects of growing changes in population, urbanization, resource availability, variations in local climates and other “global forces” that challenge economic development locally and globally. Decreasing water supplies, shifting agricultural patterns, larger coastal populations at risk from flooding and disrupted energy and transport systems are but a few of these challenges.<br><br>
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/globalai/6325756129/" title="Mexico_Flooding by GlobalAdaptation, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6218/6325756129_3dc272c87b_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; alt="Mexico_Flooding"></a>
		To adapt, we must remove obstacles in order for people, individually and in association, to implement “what works” to improve their lives. Adaptation requires local solutions and is almost always dependent upon individual action. <br><br>
		From increasing access to clean water to bolstering energy security to natural disasters, there are many ways in which communities can better protect themselves while their standard of living increases through economic growth. Freedom, economic opportunity and human ingenuity are necessary to achieve these goals.<br><br>
		“Adaptation is the business of any business.” The private sector will play a key role through innovation and by putting resources into making their investments and supply chains more resilient to global forces.<br><br> 
		<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/globalai/6326490980/" title="Mexico_Agriculture by GlobalAdaptation, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6235/6326490980_dfdd18c6dd_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" align="right" style="padding-right: 10px; alt="Mexico_Agriculture"></a>
		Thus, our central question becomes: What information do small-scale entrepreneurs use to assess risks from changes in population, urbanization, resource availability and variations in local climates in making investment decisions and what governance, economic and social conditions facilitate or prevent these investments?<br><br> 
		The ultimate goal of this project will be to increase awareness among SMEs of their opportunities to invest in and build resilience to risks from climate variability and global forces. Central to this is increasing access to guidelines and information to help SMEs manage these opportunities and risks to better understand the financial and governance conditions that will further their investments.<br><br> 
		For policymakers, at the local and national level, this project will point toward further action governments can take in facilitating local entrepreneurial activity.
