		<h1>Guidelines</h1>

<p>
We will examine vulnerabilities across 5 sectors crucial to human well-being in the face of climate change and other global forces. Once these vulnerabilities are assessed, we will see what the “readiness” for investment in your priority sectors are. Some of the cells will be pre-populated based on your state, others you will need to research and determine yourself. 
</p>

<div id="section2">
			<h2> 1 Dependence</h2>
<p>
In which sector is your company particularly dependent? Beyond normal operations, such as lighting your office or washing dishes, but that are crucial for the production of your major products and completion of services to your customers? For example, a brewer would be highly dependent on water as an input and a logistics company would be highly dependent on infrastructure.

Using several indicators per sector, the overall condition, or supply, of the sector is calculated for your state (enter your state in the search box below). However, the purpose of this project is to not only assess the current status, but to look at global trends brought about by climate, population and other changes. Thus, it is important to look at the “drivers” that will impact the quality and quantity of these sectors in decades to come. Five major drivers are listed, that, in most cases, will have an impact, to varying degrees, on these sectors.

<div id="section6">
			<h1> 5 Strategy</h1>
Several strategies exist according to the vulnerability or opportunity present in each sector. Four key strategies include: <br><br>

<ul>
<li> Investments in services or products - the SME can seek to expand in its current market by identifying specific services and products that can help communities adapt. Much of this will require new financial investments.</li><br>
<li> Change in internal practices - creating more efficient processes within the business that save energy, water and other resources. Some processes may require little capital investment while others may require installation of new machinery and technology.</li><br>
<li> Collaboration - reaching out to NGOs, other businesses and the government to develop solutions.</li><br>
<li> Gather information - there still may be no apparent path forward. New technologies and approaches may be needed. Check back with smeadaptation.org for solutions. </li><br> 
</ul>

Depending on the investment environment and government engagement, one or all of these strategies might be pursued. <br><br>
